# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Timothy!

I'm a passionate **backend developer** based in **South Korea** who believes that growing together is a more impactful and lasting path to development than growing individually.  
That's why I actively conduct reviews of the code and services I develop and enjoy documenting and sharing my work within the company. In 2024, I was recognized as the most active contributor to Confluence documentation at my work.

Because of my interest in growing together, I was selected as a **Culture Committee member** and continue to contribute to our collaborative work environment.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and strive to write better code. Looking forward to growing together!
